# @more-nopo/nopo-plugin-vitest

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7e3dcc4: Add target command delegation with `plugin`, an optional named `command`, and
  argument arrays. Plugins may declare an explicit `defaultCommand`; plugin loading
  validates defaults and planning rejects unresolved references before any work runs.
  Delegated commands retain target scope, dependencies, environment, and directory.

  Add Vitest run/list commands and Bun test/run/build commands. Vitest defaults to
  run and supports a single native invocation across selected targets; Bun defaults
  to run and preserves each target's native working directory and configuration.

  Plugin contexts expose raw argv and forwarded arguments. Boolean and equals-style
  plugin options preserve following targets.
